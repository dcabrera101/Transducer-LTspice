# Transducer-LTspice
Lab Final
My partner and I were assigned project 4 on the instructions. 
The idea was to build a circuit that models devices that turn on artificial light in response to a decrease of natural light.
Such devices are found in homes, vehicles and public facilities to save power and promote safety.
Attached is the file of the transducer itself modeled using LTspice, the lab report, and the lab instructions.
